## 🔍 Problem 

Ever stared at your energy bill wondering, **_“What’s using all that power?”_**  
That curiosity sparked our GenAI capstone. In a world of smart homes, why is understanding energy use still so hard?

🚨 **Why does this matter?**  
Because we live in a world of smart homes and connected devices, yet understanding home energy usage is still far from intuitive. Dashboards and charts exist—but they can feel impersonal, complex, or even intimidating to the average person.

What if, instead of scrolling through bar charts, you could just ask your home a question like,
**_"Why was my energy usage so high last winter?"_**
…and get an answer that makes sense?

🌍 **That was our mission:** to build a system where energy analytics becomes a conversation, not just a spreadsheet. And to do that, we combined efficient Artficial Intelligence, Machine Learning with the Natural Language power of Generative AI for Data Insights.

## 🗝️ From Numbers to Meaning: Modeling & Analysis

- 🔍 **Normality Check:** D’Agostino–Pearson test showed outdoor temperature data is non‑Gaussian.  
- 🎯 **Seasonal Comparison:** Kruskal–Wallis H‑test revealed no significant differences in temperature distributions across seasons.  
- 📈 **Trend Visualizations:** Seaborn relplots confirmed that seasonal shifts have minimal impact on temperature patterns, and that air conditioners and heaters drive the highest energy use regardless of outdoor conditions or household size.  
- ➗ **Mean Aggregation:** Plotting mean energy consumption vs. temperature and household size further validated AC/heaters as peak loads, with fridges consistently at the low end.

## ✨ The AI Analyst’s Take

📍 **LLM Comparison Summary:**  
> - 🌈 **Seasonal Temperature Trends:** Across peer homes, outdoor temperature profiles follow the same seasonal arcs—with consumption rising steadily in summer and dipping in winter—indicating shared climate-driven patterns rather than idiosyncratic behavior.  
> - 🌦️ **Energy vs. Outdoor Temperature:** In the scatter plots, air‑conditioning loads climb sharply once temperatures exceed ~25 °C, while heater usage dominates below ~10 °C; core appliances like fridge and lights stay tightly clustered regardless of temperature.  
> - 🏘️ **Energy vs. Household Size:** Per‑occupant energy use remains remarkably consistent across homes, with most of the between‑home variation driven by secondary loads (dishwasher, washing machine) rather than baseline appliances.

📌 **Aggregate Insights from Mean Trends:**  
> - 🌡️ **Temperature Sensitivity:** The **Mean Energy vs. Mean Outdoor Temperature** chart shows AC consumption rising at ~0.5 kWh/°C between 22–30 °C, while fridge and lighting vary by <0.05 kWh across the full range.  
> - 🔢 **Household Scaling:** The **Mean Energy vs. Mean Household Size** plot reveals dishwashers and washing machines each add about 0.2 kWh per extra occupant, whereas fridge and lights remain nearly flat (<0.05 kWh/member).  
> - 💡 **Efficiency Opportunities:** Many homes run their dishwasher ~10–15 % below the aggregate mean for their size—highlighting off‑peak scheduling as a simple way to shave peak demand.

By pairing **peer‑level comparisons** with **population‑level trends**, Watt‑Seer‑Compare turns raw kWh data into clear narratives and actionable insights—for example, pinpointing which appliance behaviors to target for greener, smarter living.

```python
from scipy.stats import normaltest, kruskal

# 1. Normality test
_, p = normaltest(df['Outdoor Temperature (°C)'])
alpha = 0.05
if p > alpha:
    print("Outdoor temperatures look Gaussian.")
else:
    print("Outdoor temperatures don't look Gaussian.")

# 2. Kruskal–Wallis H‑test across seasons
_, p = kruskal(
    *[group['Outdoor Temperature (°C)'].values
      for _, group in df.groupby('Season')]
)
if p > alpha:
    print("Outdoor temperatures have the same distribution per season.")
else:
    print("Outdoor temperatures don't have the same distribution per season.")

# followed by correlation analysis & outlier detection
```

import numpy as np
from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient
from google import generativeai as genai

df = pd.read_csv("/kaggle/input/.../smart_home_energy_consumption_large.csv")
df.columns = df.columns.str.strip()

api_key = UserSecretsClient().get_secret("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
genai.configure(api_key=api_key)
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')

# followed by preliminary EDA, datetime parsing, data validation routines
```
### 📚 3. TF‑IDF‑Based Chunk Retrieval

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

dataset_text = df.to_csv(index=False)
def split_text(text, chunk_size=1000):
    return [text[i:i+chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size)]

chunks = split_text(dataset_text)
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer().fit(chunks)
chunk_embeddings = vectorizer.transform(chunks)

def retrieve_relevant_chunks(query, top_k=1000):
    query_vec = vectorizer.transform([query])
    similarities = (chunk_embeddings * query_vec.T).toarray().flatten()
    top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[-top_k:]
    return [chunks[i] for i in top_indices]
```
### 🔁 4. Prompt Construction & Retry Logic

```python
import time

def build_prompt(query):
    context = "\n".join(retrieve_relevant_chunks(query))
    return f"{context}\n\nQuestion: {query}\n\nAnswer:"

def gemini_answer(prompt):
    for attempt in range(3):
        try:
            response = model.generate_content(prompt)
            return response.text.strip()
        except Exception as e:
            if "quota" in str(e).lower():
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
            else:
                return f"Gemini API error: {e}"
    return "Gemini failed after retries." 
```
### 🌡️ 5. Energy‑by‑Parameter Visualization Helper

def plot_energy_by_appliance():
total = df.groupby("Appliance Type")["Energy Consumption (kWh)"] \
          .sum().sort_values()
total.plot(kind="barh", figsize=(10, 6))
plt.title("Total Energy Consumption by Appliance")
plt.xlabel("Energy Consumption (kWh)")
plt.show()

# followed by plot_monthly_usage & plot_household_size
```
### 🐼 6. Pandas + GenAI Query Handler
```python
def answer_query(query):
    q = query.lower().strip().replace("usage", "energy consumption")
    if "temperature" in q and "energy" in q:
        df_clean = df[["Outdoor Temperature (°C)", "Energy Consumption (kWh)"]].dropna()
        df_clean["Temp Range"] = pd.cut(
            df_clean["Outdoor Temperature (°C)"],
            bins=[-20, 0, 10, 20, 30, 50],
            labels=["Freezing", "Cold", "Cool", "Warm", "Hot"]
        )
        avg_usage = df_clean.groupby("Temp Range", observed=True)["Energy Consumption (kWh)"].mean()
        pandas_answer = "📊 Average energy consumption by temperature range:\n\n" + avg_usage.to_string()
        prompt = (
            f"You are a helpful data analyst assistant.\n"
            f"Pandas Result: {pandas_answer}\n"
            f"Question: {query}\n"

def main():
    print("Enter a query (type 'quit' to stop or 'visuals' to view charts):")
    while True:
        query = input("Question: ").strip()
        if query.lower() == "quit":
            print("Exiting. Goodbye!")
            break
        elif "visual" in query.lower():
            plot_energy_by_appliance()
            plot_monthly_usage()
            plot_household_size()
        else:
            ans = answer_query(query)
            print(f"\n❓Q: {query}\n💡A: {ans}\n")

main()
```
